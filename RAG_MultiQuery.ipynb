Do not modify the provided plug. If it does not fit the outlet, call a qualified electrician to install a proper outlet. Do NOT use an extension cord. Use only the power cord that comes with the washing machine. Do NOT connect the ground wire to plastic plumbing, gas lines, or hot water Improperly connected grounding conductors may cause electric shock. Water supply A proper water pressure for this washing kPa. Water pressure less than 50 kPa may cause the water valve not to close completely. Or, it may take longer to fill the drum, causing the washing machine to turn off. Water taps must be within 120 cm from the rear of the washing machine so that the provided inlet hoses reach the To reduce the risk of leaks: Make sure water taps are easily Turn off the taps when the washing machine is not in use. Check for any leaks at the water inlet hose fittings on a regular basis. CAUTION Before using the washing machine for the first time, check all connections at the water valve and taps for any leaks. Samsung recommends a standpipe in height of 60-90 cm. The drain hose must be connected through the hose clip to the standpipe, and the standpipe must fully cover the drain hose. Untitled-5 16 English 17 For best performance, the washing machine must be installed on a solid floor. Wood floors may need to be reinforced to minimize vibration and/or unbalanced loads. Carpeting and soft tile surfaces are not a good resistance to vibrations and may cause the washing machine to move slightly during the spin cycle. CAUTION Do NOT install the washing machine on a platform or a poorly supported structure. Do not install the washing machine in areas where water may freeze as the washing machine always retains some water in its water valves, pumps, and/or hoses. Frozen water left in the connection parts may cause damage to belts, the pump, and other components of the Minimum clearance for stable operation: Top Rear If both the washing machine and a dryer are installed in the same location, the front of the alcove must have at least a 550 mm unobstructed air opening.

If there is a water leak, stop operating the washing machine and disconnect from the electrical supply. Then, contact a local Samsung service centre. Otherwise, this may cause electric shock. CAUTION Do not stretch the water hose by force. If the hose is too short, replace the hose with a longer, high-pressure hose. After connecting the water hose to the adaptor, check if it is connected properly by pulling the water hose downwards. Use a popular type of water taps. If the tap is square-shaped or too big, remove the spacer ring before inserting the tap into the adaptor. Untitled-5 21 English For models with an additional hot water inlet: 1. Connect the red end of the hot water hose to the hot water inlet on the back of the machine. 2. Connect the other end of the hot water hose to the hot water tap. Aqua stop hose (applicable models only) The aqua stop hose alerts users of any water leak risks. It senses the water flow and turns red on the centre indicator (A) in case of a leak. The end of the aqua stop hose must be fitted to the water tap and not the machine. Untitled-5 22 English 23 STEP 5 Position the drain hose The drain hose can be positioned in three ways: Over the edge of a wash basin The drain hose must be placed at a height of between 60 cm and 90 cm (*) from the floor. To keep the spout of the drain hose bent, use the supplied plastic hose guide (A). Secure the guide to the wall using a hook to ensure stable drainage. The drain pipe must be above the sink siphon so that the end of the hose is at least 60 cm above the floor. The drain pipe should be between 60 cm and 90 cm high (*).

Small, light clothing such as socks, gloves, stockings, and handkerchiefs may become caught around the door. Place them inside a fine laundry net. Do not wash the laundry net by itself without other laundry. This may cause abnormal vibrations that could move the washing machine and result in injury. STEP 4 Prewash (if necessary) Select the Prewash option for the selected cycle if the laundry is heavily soiled. When selecting the Prewash option, make sure to put powder-type detergent into the main wash STEP 5 Determine the load capacity Do not overload the washing machine. Overloading may cause the washing machine to not wash properly. For the load capacity for the type of clothing, see page 35. When washing bedding or bedding covers, the wash time may be lengthened or the spin efficiency may be reduced. For bedding or bedding covers, the recommended maximum spin cycle speed is 800 rpm, and the load capacity is 2.0 kg or less. CAUTION If the laundry is unbalanced and the Ub information code is displayed, redistribute the load. Unbalanced laundry may reduce the spinning performance. Untitled-5 26 English 27 Before you start The type of detergent depends on the type of fabric (cotton, synthetic, delicate items, wool), colour, wash temperature, and degree of soiling. Make sure to use the laundry detergent that is designed for automatic washing machines. Follow the detergent manufacturers recommendations based on the weight of the laundry, the degree of soiling, and the hardness of the water in your local area. If you are not sure about the water hardness, contact a local water authority. Do not use detergent that tends to be hardened or solidified. This detergent may remain after the rinse cycle, blocking the drain outlet. CAUTION When washing wool using the WOOL cycle, use only a neutral liquid detergent. If used with the WOOL cycle, powder detergent may remain on the laundry and discolour the To get the best results from using laundry capsules, please follow these instructions. 1.
